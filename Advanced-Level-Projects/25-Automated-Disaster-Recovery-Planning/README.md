# Automated Disaster Recovery Planning

## Overview

In this project, you will learn how to design and implement automated disaster recovery plans to ensure high availability and business continuity. This project is designed for advanced-level DevOps engineers who want to gain hands-on experience with backup and failover mechanisms.

## Prerequisites

- Advanced knowledge of backup and recovery strategies
- Familiarity with cloud services and infrastructure
- A cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
- A sample application to test the disaster recovery plan

## Project Structure

- `backup-scripts`: This directory contains the backup scripts and configuration files.
- `failover-scripts`: This directory contains the failover scripts and configuration files.
- `README.md`: This file provides detailed instructions and explanations for the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zpratikpathak/Awesome-25-DevOps-Project.git
   cd Awesome-25-DevOps-Project/Advanced-Level-Projects/25-Automated-Disaster-Recovery-Planning
   ```

2. Create `backup-scripts` and `failover-scripts` directories in the project directory and add the backup and failover scripts and configuration files.

## Example Backup Script

### 1. AWS S3 Backup Script

This script creates a backup of the application data and uploads it to an AWS S3 bucket.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
BUCKET_NAME="my-backup-bucket"
BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backup"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
BACKUP_FILE="backup-$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"

# Create a backup
tar -czvf $BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE /path/to/application/data

# Upload the backup to S3
aws s3 cp $BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE s3://$BUCKET_NAME/
```

## Example Failover Script

### 1. AWS EC2 Failover Script

This script automates the failover process by launching a new EC2 instance from a pre-configured AMI.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Variables
AMI_ID="ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
INSTANCE_TYPE="t2.micro"
KEY_NAME="my-key-pair"
SECURITY_GROUP="my-security-group"
SUBNET_ID="subnet-0bb1c79de3EXAMPLE"

# Launch a new EC2 instance
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id $AMI_ID --instance-type $INSTANCE_TYPE --key-name $KEY_NAME --security-group-ids $SECURITY_GROUP --subnet-id $SUBNET_ID
```

## Applying the Configuration

1. Make the backup and failover scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x backup-scripts/*.sh
   chmod +x failover-scripts/*.sh
   ```

2. Run the backup script to create and upload a backup:
   ```bash
   ./backup-scripts/aws-s3-backup.sh
   ```

3. Run the failover script to launch a new EC2 instance:
   ```bash
   ./failover-scripts/aws-ec2-failover.sh
   ```

4. Verify that the backup has been uploaded to the S3 bucket and the new EC2 instance has been launched successfully.

## Conclusion

By completing this project, you will have gained a solid understanding of how to design and implement automated disaster recovery plans. Feel free to modify the example scripts and create your own backup and failover configurations to further enhance your skills.
