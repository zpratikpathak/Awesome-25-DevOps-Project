# Automated Security Audits

## Overview

In this project, you will learn how to implement automated security audits using various security scanning tools. This project is designed for advanced-level DevOps engineers who want to integrate security into their CI/CD pipelines and ensure the security of their applications and infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- Advanced knowledge of CI/CD pipelines
- Familiarity with security scanning tools (e.g., OpenVAS, Clair, Trivy)
- A CI/CD tool installed on your machine (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
- A sample project repository

## Project Structure

- `security-scans`: This directory contains the configuration files for the security scanning tools.
- `README.md`: This file provides detailed instructions and explanations for the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zpratikpathak/Awesome-25-DevOps-Project.git
   cd Awesome-25-DevOps-Project/Advanced-Level-Projects/23-Automated-Security-Audits
   ```

2. Create a `security-scans` directory in the project directory and add the configuration files for the security scanning tools.

## Example Security Scanning Configuration

### 1. OpenVAS Configuration

This configuration sets up an OpenVAS security scan.

```yaml
openvas:
  target: "http://example.com"
  report_format: "PDF"
  scan_config: "Full and fast"
```

### 2. Clair Configuration

This configuration sets up a Clair security scan for Docker images.

```yaml
clair:
  image: "my-sample-app:latest"
  output: "clair-report.json"
```

### 3. Trivy Configuration

This configuration sets up a Trivy security scan for Docker images.

```yaml
trivy:
  image: "my-sample-app:latest"
  output: "trivy-report.json"
```

## Integrating Security Scans into CI/CD Pipeline

1. Create a `Jenkinsfile` in the project directory and open it in your text editor.

## Example Jenkinsfile

### 1. Jenkins Pipeline with Security Scans

This Jenkinsfile sets up a CI/CD pipeline that includes security scans using OpenVAS, Clair, and Trivy.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t my-sample-app .'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker run my-sample-app npm test'
            }
        }

        stage('Security Scan - OpenVAS') {
            steps {
                sh 'openvas -c security-scans/openvas.yaml'
            }
        }

        stage('Security Scan - Clair') {
            steps {
                sh 'clair -c security-scans/clair.yaml'
            }
        }

        stage('Security Scan - Trivy') {
            steps {
                sh 'trivy -c security-scans/trivy.yaml'
            }
        }

        stage('Push') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'dockerhub-credentials', usernameVariable: 'DOCKERHUB_USERNAME', passwordVariable: 'DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD')]) {
                    sh 'docker login -u $DOCKERHUB_USERNAME -p $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD'
                    sh 'docker tag my-sample-app $DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/my-sample-app:latest'
                    sh 'docker push $DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/my-sample-app:latest'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                kubernetesDeploy(
                    configs: 'k8s/deployment.yaml',
                    kubeconfigId: 'kubeconfig'
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

By completing this project, you will have gained a solid understanding of how to implement automated security audits using various security scanning tools. Feel free to modify the example configurations and create your own security scanning configurations to further enhance your skills.
